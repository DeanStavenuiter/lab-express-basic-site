        <h1>Van Gogh</h1>
        <p>
          Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
          Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
          famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he
          created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most
          of which date from the last two years of his life. They include
          landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are
          characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive
          brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Not
          commercially successful in his career, he struggled with severe
          depression and poverty, which eventually led to his suicide at age
          thirty-seven.
