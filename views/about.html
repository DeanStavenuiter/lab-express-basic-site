        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Born into an upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and
          was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man, he worked as an
          art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was
          transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a
          Protestant missionary in predominantly Roman Catholic southern
          Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up
          painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger
          brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long
          correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and
          depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour
          that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where
          he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul
          Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As
          his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local
          landscapes. His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that
          became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France
          in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include
          series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.

          Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he
          worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical
          health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with
          Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he
          severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric
          hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged
          himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris,
          he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His
          depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to
          have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his
          injuries two days later.

          Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was
          considered a madman and a failure. As he became famous only after his
          suicide, he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public
          imagination.[6] His reputation grew in the early 20th century as
          elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German
          Expressionists. He attained widespread critical and commercial success
          over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic
          painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the
          tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most
          expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a
          museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the
          world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.
